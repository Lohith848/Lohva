## What is CYRUS?

CYRUS is a personal AI assistant built for Windows — think JARVIS from Iron Man, running entirely on your machine. Wake it with a single word, speak any command naturally, and CYRUS handles the rest: launching apps, reading emails, messaging contacts, searching files, and answering anything — all hands free.

All AI processing runs **locally via Ollama**. Your voice never leaves your PC.

## Features

| # | Capability | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 01 | **Voice Control** | Say `"Nova"` to wake. Speak any command naturally — no keyboard, no clicks |
| 02 | **AI Brain** | Powered by Ollama LLM — runs 100% offline, no cloud required |
| 03 | **Messaging** | Send Telegram messages by voice. WhatsApp Web automation included |
| 04 | **Gmail** | Read unread emails aloud. Compose and send with a single spoken command |
| 05 | **System Control** | Open apps, adjust volume, monitor CPU/RAM, shutdown, sleep, and lock |
| 06 | **Live Weather** | Real-time conditions and 3-day forecasts for any city. No API key needed |
| 07 | **Memory** | Tell CYRUS to remember facts and reminders. Recall them anytime by asking |
| 08 | **File Search** | Find any file on your PC by name. Open folders and documents by voice |
| 09 | **Notion** | Create pages and search your entire Notion workspace by voice |

## How It Works

```
Say "Nova"  →  HUD appears  →  Speak command  →  CYRUS executes  →  Speaks back  →  HUD closes
```

1. **Wake** — Say `"Nova"` → Arc Reactor HUD appears on screen instantly
2. **Command** — Speak naturally. Vosk handles speech recognition fully offline
3. **Execute** — Command is routed to the correct handler (system / AI / messaging / web)
4. **Reply** — CYRUS speaks back, HUD closes, and waits for the next wake word
